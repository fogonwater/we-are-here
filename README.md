# We Are Here: An Atlas of Aotearoa
## Technical notes, data sources and code

This repository contains code and data for [We Are Here: An Atlas of Aotearoa](https://masseypress.ac.nz/books/all/all/we-are-here). This is the place to look if you are curious where the data came from and how we created the various maps and charts. We have tried to include as much of the source code as possible.

Although we used [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) heavily, we have not included any QGIS project files as Chris didn't really set them up with distribution in mind (aka they're a bit of a mess).

The repository is organised into folders that correspond to the book's chapters. If you are interested in something that's not here, please get in touch with Chris McDowall through Github or via this [contact form](https://fogonwater.com/).

## Here be dragons...

Be warned that this code was written to get the job done rather than with an audience in mind. There are rough edges and confusing bits. Good luck, adventurer!
